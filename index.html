     <h1>Anime & Video Games</h1>
    <p>I like to watch anime. My favorite anime at the momment is attack on titan. I started watching anime when i was a little kid my cousin had watched dragon ball with me.
        I had stopped watching anime for a little while but in 2020 during lockdown i started to get back into it. My favorite animes were Attack on Titian, Cowboy Bepop, My hero Academia,
        A Silent Voice, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, And many more. In the time that i had spent during the covid lockdown anime wasnt the only thing i did i also started p[aying alot more video games and figuring out the type of games i actually like to play </p>
