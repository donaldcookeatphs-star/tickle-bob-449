    <h1>Anime and its history</h1>
    <p>Anime started off in the early 1900's of japan it became very popular over the time of these recent years. I started watching anime around 2020 and maybe even longer my
        cousin would watch anime with me when i was a kid and show me stuff like dragon ball and other like that he shared alot with me and is mainly the reason i watch stuff like this and 
        main reason i know alot and can recommend animes. All images used in this were sourced from rottentomatoes.com.
