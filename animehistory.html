    <p>Anime started off in the early 1900's of japan.The first known animes were normally often short and silent films a good example of that would be 
        Namakura Gatana also known as the dull sword. During WW2 anime was used for propaganda this was the from 1930's till the 1940's. Anime post war was 
        was a turning point in the industry as Osamu Tezuka had started animation this resulted into creating a back bone to modern day anime as Astro Boy came out in 1968 and was and still is possibly the most 
        popular anime. Now the 1970s introduced the mecha genre and the 1980s was a golden age was animation started getting a better budget and expermential films.</p>
